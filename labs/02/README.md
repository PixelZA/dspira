# Software Defined Radio - Hardware

Most of the signal processing is done on the computer through gnuradio but the signal needs to be digitized. SDR peripheral hardware sample the analog signal digitizing it. The most simple example of an analog signal being digitized is the microphone of the computer. The microphone converts sound into electrical signal which is sampled and discretized to be processed by the computer processor and reconverted back into audio.
