# A Radio Telescope

## 6.1. Horn Antenna

## 6.2  21cm Low Noise Amplifier

The Neutral Hydrogen signal from the Milky Way galaxy is very faint, and the telescope needs an amplifier that adds as little noise to the signal as possible.  We have designed a low noise amplifier for you to use which will add less than 50 Kelvin noise temperature to the incoming signal.  See the attached pdf for assembly instructions:

[LNA assembly Instructions](DSPIRA_LNA_assembly.pdf)

A brief memo on the initial design and performance of the LNA is here:

## 6.3 Spectrometer.  

Use the spectrometer you designed in [Lab 5](../05)

You may want to upgrade your spectrometer to use a different output than just a standard binary data file (which you'll have to know ahead of time how to interpret).

You can use an out-of-tree module to instead save the data to an HDF5 file, which will then include additional information about what the data is, to help interpretation. ...

## 6.4  Observe.
