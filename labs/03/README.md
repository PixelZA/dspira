# Fourier Analysis

Fourier Analysis is a very powerful tool that comes into play when we discuss periodic signals. Colloquially, a periodic signal repeats.  Mathematically a signal $$x(t)$$ is periodic if there exists a positive constant $$T$$ such that:
$$
x(t) = x(t + T)
$$
for all values of $$t$$. The smallest value of $$T$$ for which this is true is called the fundamental period and is denoted $$T_o$$. The corresponding *fundamental frequency* is $$f_o = \frac{1}{T_o}$$. If $$T_o$$ is in seconds, then $$f_o$$ is in Hertz (Hz). The fundamental angular frequency is $$\omega_o = 2\pi f_o$$ and is measured in rad/sec.
