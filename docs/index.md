## 1.1. Introduction 

Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) is an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the West Virginia University Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The Principal Investigators are Professors Natalia Schmid and Kevin Bandura. The GBO coordinator is Richard Prestage

Aims of this program: 
1. Prepare teachers to implement DSP projects with their students, exposing them to exciting STEM career opportunities;
2. Inspire high school students to pursue careers in STEM disciplines; 
3. Broaden the reach of the DSP activities developed through DSPIRA, and 
4. Develop the communication / pedagogical skills of the teachers, project staff, graduate and undergraduate students.
